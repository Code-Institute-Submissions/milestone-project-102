Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section
First Time Visitor Goals
As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Video from YouTube.
The user has a few options, navigate to the gallery , lineup or ticket page or they can stay on the home page and watch the video teaser and read down the webpage.

The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a logo which the user can click on to redirect them to the home page, there is also our social links.
As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.

Once the new visitor has watched the hero video, they will be greeted by a little article section including an article about our Headline act, where the festival is held and an article about covid-19 realted to this years rendition of the festival.
The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.

Returning Visitor Goals

These are clearly shown in the banner message.
They will be directed to a page with the lineup on a poster which was made in a 3rd party applicationn.
As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" section of the footer.
Here they message the organisation on social media or they can call/email the organisation.
The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and YouTube page as well as the organization's email and phone number.
Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.

Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
